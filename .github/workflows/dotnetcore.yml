  # As a general code quality check we use FxCop analyzers.
  #
  # To check for build warnings locally you may need to run a clean build.
  #
  # This can be done by running `dotnet clean` before running `dotnet build`

  #
  # To check for failing tests locally run `dotnet test`.
  #
  # Although you can build previous versions of .NET Core projects with the
  # latest SDK you can't run them. So to run tests for all target versions you
  # will need all current LTS version runtimes installed.
  #
  # If installing all required runtimes is problematic you can specify a
  # particular version like this `dotnet test --framework netcoreapp2.1`.
