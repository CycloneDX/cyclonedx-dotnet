# CycloneDX module for .NET

The CycloneDX module for .NET creates a valid CycloneDX bill-of-material document containing an aggregate of all project dependencies. CycloneDX is a lightweight BOM specification that is easily created, human readable, and simple to parse.

This module runs on 
*   .NET 6.0
*   .NET 7.0

This module no longer runs on
*   .NET Core 2.1
*   .NET Core 3.1
*   .NET 5.0 
*   see https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core for more information

## Usage

CycloneDX for .NET is distributed via NuGet and Docker Hub. 

#### Installing via NuGet

#### Examples
To run the **CycloneDX** tool you need to specify a solution or project file. In case you pass a solution, the tool will aggregate all the projects.

The following will create a BOM from a solution and all projects defined within:
```bash
dotnet CycloneDX YourSolution.sln -o /output/path
```

The following will recursively scan the directory structure for packages.config and create a BOM:
```bash
dotnet CycloneDX /path/to/project -o /output/path
```

The following will recursively scan the project references of the supplied project file, and create a BOM of all package references from all included projects:
```bash
dotnet CycloneDX /path/to/project/MyProject.csproj -o /output/path -r
```

_Update the data and import it within a build pipeline e.g. create the file using a script and add also dynamic data (version, timestamp, ...)_ 

#### GitHub License Resolution

SPDX license IDs can be resolved for packages that reference a supported license
file in a GitHub repository.

The GitHub license API has an unauthenticated call limit of 60 calls per hour.
To ensure consistent output if a rate limit is exceeded BOM generation will
fail. If you start hitting rate limits you will need to generate a personal
access token and provide this, and your username, when running CycloneDX.

To generate a token go to
[Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) under
`Settings / Developer setings`. From there select the option to
[Generate new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). No special token
permissions are required.

Due to current limitations in the GitHub API licenses will only be resolved for
master branch license references.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. But please read the
[CycloneDX contributing guidelines](https://github.com/CycloneDX/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

To build and test the solution locally you should have .NET Core 3.1 or .NET 6.0
installed. Standard commands like `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` work.

Alternatively, you can use VS Code and the included devcontainer configuration
to work in a pre-configured docker image. (You will also need the "Remote - Containers"
extension and Docker)

It is generally expected that pull requests will include relevant tests.
Tests are automatically run on Windows, MacOS and Linux for every pull request.
And build warnings will break the build.

If you are having trouble debugging a test that is failing for a platform you
don't have access to please us know.

Thanks to [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) there is a really easy way of creating
a ready to go development environment with VS Code. You can open a Gitpod
hosted development environment in your browser.
